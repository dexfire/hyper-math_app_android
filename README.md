A math learning handbook on Android

We are aiming to make a usefull handbook for college students who are struggling in learning advanced mathematics.

## Project Structure

We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to organize contents, which uses pretty Markdown rules to write things.  
Around app side, We use a WebView to show the content already downloaded for offline reading.

## Features

- show pretty formulas with [mathjax](https://mathjax.org)!
- offline uses
  - save your net-traffic
  - good reading experience
- some usefull tools(toys) injected.
- take note in MarkDown rules with it!

## Progress

It's under-develop now.

- [x] Local html book viewer.
- [ ] Online update from github or private server.
- [ ] Theme manager which dynmically changes the app & web style.
